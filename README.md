# Slate+Simple Jekyll Theme

This template is based on [Slate-and-Simple-Jekyll-Theme](https://github.com/benradford/Slate-and-Simple-Jekyll-Theme) by [Benjamin Radford](https://github.com/benradford). 


YAML headers include support for:

* title
* subtitle
* author
* featured-image
* date-string
* categories
* tags

Additionally, support [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) for beautiful equations and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). LaTeX math wrapped in `$$` will automatically compile to in-line or block images of formatted equations. Font awesome icons are included with the `i` tag. For example: `<i class='fa fa-github-alt'></i>`.
